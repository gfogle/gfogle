# CLI
This is the code for the Command Line Interface (CLI) that users interact with while scaffolding projects, creating controllers and models etc.

The code follows two design patterns: [Interpreter](https://www.oodesign.com/interpreter-pattern.html) for taking user input _expressions_, generating a _context_ object with that input mapped to an output [Command](https://www.oodesign.com/command-pattern.html) which executes on that context.
