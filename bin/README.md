# ðŸ“‚ bin
A collection of scripts I've accumulated over the years; usually aliased in the `Makefile`. Depending on your level of committment, or lack thereof I suppose, you can try to curl-pipe to bash instead.

## How To Use
There's an assumption that you already have this repo cloned, which means you also already have `git` installed locally as well.

- ðŸ“„ `make install` will set up a developer station with all the things I find useful: git aliases, packages and tooling, etc.
