### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ§° Projects Iâ€™m currently working on

### ðŸ”‹ **monorepo** 
a CLI to generate a monorepo template project with the batteries-included setup for developer workflows, CICD, etc. Uses [sparse checkouts](https://github.blog/2020-01-17-bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/) and a YAML file to declare the structure of your *applications and services*. 

The goal is to create monorepos that ideally hundreds - even thousands - of developers could work in without all the negative connotations that come along with the word "monorepo" like slow review cycles, excessive storage size, etc.

### ðŸ”‹ **mweb** 
a CLI to generate a Ruby on Rails inspired Node.js web application with minimal dependencies.

The project experiments with newer technologies like [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) and [Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) to get away from the large amount of setup baked into web applications today.

The goal is to conceptually leverage paradigms from Ruby on Rails, especially [Engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html), to create a microfrontend-like developer workflow while also using as much vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript as possible.
