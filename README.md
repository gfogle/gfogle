### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is where I keep all of my public projects and gists. If anything here seems interesting, feel free to contact me via [ðŸ“¬ email](mailto:georgefogle@hey.com).

Currently, I'm interested in focused on creating a monorepo codebase that hundreds, even thousands, of engineers could work on simulataneously with minimal friction. The core set of technologies I'm using to make that happen are web servers using [vertx](https://vertx.io/), built and deployed with [bazel](https://bazel.build/) and hosted on [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## ðŸ§° Projects
Currently, a few of the projects that I'm working on to support that example project are:

### `bin` installation
This is a script that recreates my entire dev profile in the instance I get a new laptop. It's meant to simulate what an engineer might run as a new hire starting on day one to get their machine set up.

### Localstack
This project sets up [localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) on a [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) instance to allow for local-only development of AWS-hosted projects. This facilitates local DynamoDB databases, SQS queues, etc.

### DynamoDB migration CLI
This is my small project to be like a [knex]() for DynamoDB to recreate a DynamoDB table from nothing.

### Bazel and Kubernetes

I'm migrating my various subprojects to this repo and using a Bazel build system. I'm changing all of my Docker + Compose based projects to instead run locally on Kubernetes.



### ðŸ”‹ **fmono**
a Fastify monorepo template project with a batteries-included setup. The goal is to create a web + api monorepo that ideally hundreds - even thousands - of developers could work in without all the negative connotations that come along with the word "monorepo" like slow review cycles, excessive storage size, etc.

The server uses the Fastify [plugin system](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Plugins/) which is similar to Rails [engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) to encapsulate sections of an application: home, login, search etc.

The client-side is inspired by other tooling - and even uses some of - [wmr](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr), [snowpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack) etc. to take advantage of [Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) and eliminate alot of the tooling around setting up "modern" web applications; while still providing a production pipeline with tools like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for efficient bundling, minification etc. if that's something your application requires.
