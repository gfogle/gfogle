Currently consolidating and migrating my various subprojects to this repo using a Bazel build system.

### ğŸ”‹ **fmono**
a Fastify monorepo template project with a batteries-included setup. The goal is to create a web + api monorepo that ideally hundreds - even thousands - of developers could work in without all the negative connotations that come along with the word "monorepo" like slow review cycles, excessive storage size, etc.

The server uses the Fastify [plugin system](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Plugins/) which is similar to Rails [engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) to encapsulate sections of an application: home, login, search etc.

The client-side is inspired by other tooling - and even uses some of - [wmr](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr), [snowpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack) etc. to take advantage of [Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) and eliminate alot of the tooling around setting up "modern" web applications; while still providing a production pipeline with tools like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for efficient bundling, minification etc. if that's something your application requires.


**gfogle/gfogle** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
