## 🧰 Projects
Below are the projects that I'm either currently working on or are inside of this repo and relatively stable.

### Bazel and Kubernetes

I'm migrating my various subprojects to this repo and using a Bazel build system. I'm changing all of my Docker + Compose based projects to instead run locally on Kubernetes.

### 🔋 **fmono**
a Fastify monorepo template project with a batteries-included setup. The goal is to create a web + api monorepo that ideally hundreds - even thousands - of developers could work in without all the negative connotations that come along with the word "monorepo" like slow review cycles, excessive storage size, etc.

The server uses the Fastify [plugin system](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Plugins/) which is similar to Rails [engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) to encapsulate sections of an application: home, login, search etc.

The client-side is inspired by other tooling - and even uses some of - [wmr](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr), [snowpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack) etc. to take advantage of [Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) and eliminate alot of the tooling around setting up "modern" web applications; while still providing a production pipeline with tools like [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for efficient bundling, minification etc. if that's something your application requires.
